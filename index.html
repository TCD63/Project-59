        <p class="para">My hobbies are to play sports such as Cricket and Basketball. I get inspiration from my teammates and also by watching cricket matches around the world. My other hobby is Chess, which I mainly do for timepass and to fulfill my time wisely. Most of the time, I love listening to music using Spotify because it gives me some relaxation and makes me feel like I am in my own world. I practically grew up with music and songs are the things that help me relax while studying or doing something like playing games too. My other talent I like to utilise my time with is playing the piano as it is good hand exercise.

        <h1>Here is some additional info about my hobby of listening to Music.</h1>
        
        <p class="para">Music is something I love to do every single time and every single day. I find music helping as it relaxes my mind and I can do other things more actively with music. Sometimes I sing too so that I can know the lyrics and help myself concentrate further. Without music, life would be very dull to me and boring too because there will be practically nothing that gives me good vibes while doing some sort of task. I get headphones every birthday just to enjoy my time to the fullest and I even have my own accounts for all platforms to enjoy my own way.
